## Hello :wave:! I'm shigeosapsycho!

### Introduction



### :dart: Current Focus

I am currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science **and** Finance at the [university](https://www.csulb.edu/ "California State University of Long Beach") I attend.

When I am not actively engaged in computer-related activities, I enjoy socializing and spending time with friends. I also enjoy listening to music, driving, and trying new things while eating at different places. I also strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising at the gym and eating a balanced diet. Another hobby of mine is collecting Pok√©mon cards.
